## How has the Global Gag Rule impacted NGOs?

-   Within organizations that chose to be compliant to the policy, a crucial part of reproductive health care is lost to many communities, and especially those in lower income areas.Â 

-   Within organizations that chose to forgo US funds and continue abortion services, an important financial assistance was lost and studies have shown this to cause a major decline in contraceptive resources offered by those ngos.

-   Furthermore, even in times of inactivity, data from South Africa shows that there is no change to the number of abortions per year.potentially due to worry that the policy will either likely be brought back in a few years, or NGOs are confused of the status and details of the policy.

-   Other studies find that active policy years increase abortions, making the purpose of the policy unsuccessful
